          title or ownership in or to any such Virtual Currency. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT
          VIRTUAL CURRENCY HAS NO CASH VALUE AND THAT NEITHER Dialect NOR ANY OTHER PERSON OR ENTITY
          HAS ANY OBLIGATION TO EXCHANGE YOUR VIRTUAL CURRENCY FOR ANYTHING OF VALUE, INCLUDING
          WITHOUT LIMITATION, REAL CURRENCY, AND THAT, IF YOUR Dialect ACCOUNT IS TERMINATED,

        <Paragraph>
          We reserve the right to charge fees for the right to access or use Virtual Currency,
          and/or may distribute Virtual Currency without charge, in our sole discretion. You
          acknowledge and agree that we may revise or take action that impacts the perceived value
          of, or pricing for, any Virtual Currency at any time except to the extent that we agree
          otherwise in writing. Virtual Currency will expire after 24 months of non-use of your

          7.3 Managing Your Virtual Currency. All purchases of Virtual Currency are final and under
          no circumstances will be refundable, transferable or exchangeable
        </SectionSub>
        <Paragraph>
          By purchasing Virtual Currency, you are confirming that you want the Virtual Currency
          immediately credited to your Dialect Account and that by doing so you lose any
          cancellation rights under applicable laws.
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          We have the absolute right to manage, regulate, control, modify and/or eliminate such
          Virtual Currency as we see fit in our sole discretion, and we shall have no liability to
          you or anyone else for the exercise of such rights. For example, Virtual Currency will be
          lost, deleted from your Dialect Account or forfeited when/if your Dialect Account is
          terminated, suspended or closed for any reason or when we discontinue any or all of the
          Dialect Product, including without limitation any services provided or offered through
          third party platforms.
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to make all calculations regarding the
          balance of Virtual Currency in your Dialect Account. We further reserve the right, in our
          sole discretion, to determine the amount of Virtual Currency that is credited and debited
          from your Dialect Account in connection with your use of the Dialect Product. While we
          strive to make all such calculations on a consistent and reasonable basis, you hereby
          acknowledge and agree that our determination of the amount of Virtual Currency in your
          Dialect Account is final, unless you can provide documentation to us that such calculation
          was or is intentionally incorrect.

        <SectionSub>7.4 Transfers of Virtual Currency; Unauthorized Transactions</SectionSub>
        <Paragraph>
          Any unauthorized transferring, trading, selling or exchanging of any Virtual Currency or
          Dialect Accounts ("Unauthorized Transactions") with anyone, including with other users of
          the Dialect Product, is not sanctioned by us and is strictly forbidden. All Members who
          participate in such activities do so at their own risk and hereby agree to indemnify
          Dialect against any and all consequences resulting from such actions. You acknowledge that
          Dialect may stop, suspend, terminate, discontinue or reverse any Unauthorized Transactions
          when Dialect suspects or has evidence of fraud, violations of these Dialect Terms,
          violations of any other applicable law or regulation or any intentional act designed to
          interfere at all with the normal operation of the Services. You further agree that Dialect
          may, in Dialectâ€™s sole discretion, reverse any transaction if such reversal is in
          Dialectâ€™s best interest, or may debit your balance of Virtual Currency, including without
          limitation, taking actions, which may cause your balance to be zero and/or a negative
          amount. Dialect may, in Dialectâ€™s sole discretion, terminate, suspend or modify your
          Dialect Account if you engage or assist in any Unauthorized Transactions. Verification of
          certain information applicable to a transaction involving Virtual Currency may be required
          prior to our acceptance thereof. In addition, as a condition to receiving certain Virtual
          Currency or other awards for participating in promotions, giveaways, contests or
          sweepstakes, you may be required to provide additional information about yourself in our
          marketing materials. You acknowledge and agree that Dialect shall have no liability for
          the use or loss of such information and/or Virtual Currency due to any unauthorized third
          party activity, such as hacking, phishing, password mining, social engineering and/or any
          other unauthorized third party or other userâ€™s activity. Dialect may replace such lost
          Virtual Currency under certain circumstances, at Dialectâ€™s sole discretion on a
          case-by-case basis, without incurring any obligation or liability. You may be required to
          provide the Dialect or our designated representative with your credit card number or other
          billing information, and related information, in order to purchase Virtual Currency.
          Dialect may also provide you with the option of participating in third party offers to
          receive Virtual Currency.

          the Dialect Platform, these Dialect Terms or the relationship between you and Dialect
          (collectively, "Disputes"). Most Disputes are quickly resolved in this manner to our
          usersâ€™ satisfaction. The parties shall use their best efforts to settle any Dispute
          directly through consultation and good faith negotiations which shall be a precondition to
          either party initiating a lawsuit or arbitration.

        <ol type="i">
          <li>
            <PStyle>
              Agreement to Arbitrate. If the parties do not agree upon a resolution in connection
              with a Dispute within a period of thirty (30) calendar days from the time informal
              dispute resolution is initiated pursuant to Section 22.1 (Initial Dispute Resolution),
              then either party may initiate binding arbitration as the sole means to formally
              resolve claims (the "Agreement to Arbitrate"), subject to the terms set forth below.
              Specifically, all Disputes shall be finally settled by binding arbitration
              administered by the American Arbitration Association (the "AAA"). The arbitration
              proceedings shall be governed by AAAâ€™s Commercial Arbitration Rules (the "AAA Rules")
              and, where appropriate, AAAâ€™s Supplementary Procedures for Resolution of
              Consumer-Related Disputes (the "AAA Consumer Rules"). This arbitration provision is
              made pursuant to a transaction involving interstate commerce, and the Federal
              Arbitration Act shall apply to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability and
              formation of these Dialect Terms notwithstanding any other choice of law provision
              contained in these Dialect Terms. The arbitrator, and not any federal, state or local
              court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve all disputes arising out of
              or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of these
              Dialect Terms, including without limitation any claim that all or any party of these
              Dialect Terms are void or voidable, or whether a claim is subject to arbitration. The
              arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court
              under law or in equity. The arbitratorâ€™s award shall be binding on the parties and may
              be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.

          </li>

            <PStyle>
              The arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by
              phone or online. The arbitrator shall make a decision in writing, and shall provide a
              statement of reasons if requested by either party. The arbitrator must follow
              applicable law, and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so.

              governed by the AAA Rules and, where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer Rules.
              The parties understand that, absent this mandatory provision, they would have the
              right to sue in court and have a jury trial. They further understand that, in some
              instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the cost of litigation and the right
              to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court.

              Class Action Waiver. The parties further agree that any arbitration shall be conducted
              in their individual capacities only and not as a class action or other representative
              action, and the parties expressly waive their right to file a class action or seek
              relief on a class basis. YOU AND Dialect AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE
              OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR Dialectâ€™S INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS
              MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. If any court or arbitrator
              determines that the class action waiver set forth in this subsection is void or
              unenforceable for any reason or that an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then
              the arbitration provision set forth above shall be deemed null and void in its
              entirety and the parties shall be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate Disputes.

              Notwithstanding the partiesâ€™ decision to resolve all Disputes through arbitration,
              either party may bring an action in state or federal court that only asserts claims
              for patent infringement or invalidity, copyright infringement, moral rights
              violations, trademark infringement and/or trade secret misappropriation, but not, for

          The failure of Dialect to enforce any right or provision of these Dialect Terms will not
          constitute a waiver of future enforcement of that right or provision. The waiver of any
          such right or provision will be effective only if in writing and signed by a duly
          authorized representative of Dialect. Except as expressly set forth in these Dialect
          Terms, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under these Dialect Terms will
          be without prejudice to its other remedies under these Dialect Terms or otherwise. If for
          any reason an arbitrator or a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of these
          Dialect Terms invalid or unenforceable, that provision will be enforced to the maximum
          extent permissible and the other provisions of these Dialect Terms will remain in full
          force and effect.
