        <Paragraph>
          {`We take commercially reasonable security measures to help protect information we collect
          about you from loss, theft, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and
          destruction. These security measures may include practices such as keeping your sensitive
          data on a secured server behind a firewall, and transmitting sensitive information (such
          as a credit card number) entered while using the Dialect Platform using secure socket layer
          technology ("SSL").Unfortunately, however, no security system is 100% secure, and we
          cannot guarantee that the information we collect from you will be free from unauthorized
          access by third parties. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure and other
          factors may compromise the security of user information. Your password is an important
          component of our security system, and as a result it is your responsibility to protect
          your password. Do not share your password with any third parties. If your password has
          been compromised for any reason, you should change your password immediately.`}

          transfer your information to affiliated entities or third parties to jurisdictions outside

          protection laws as your own jurisdiction. We take steps to ensure that there are adequate
          safeguards and mechanisms in place to allow the transfer of your information across
          borders outside of the EEA.

          tracking, including certain analytics and tailored advertising by changing your cookie
